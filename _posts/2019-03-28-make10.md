excerpt: Put in 4 numbers and a goal number to find all ways to reach the goal using +, –, × and ÷.
---

Have you ever sat down on a train to have your friend poke you, point to the train's carriage number and ask, "Can you make 10?"

This project tells you how to make 10, given the 4 numbers in your train's carriage.

Infact, it's extensible to act as a solver to find an arithmetic solution to any sequence of 4 numbers and a goal.

## Demo

See: [https://make10.sanjayn.com/](https://make10.sanjayn.com/)

## How it works

It boils down to two steps:

1. Generate all possible post-fix expressions involving the 4 numbers with the operations (+, –, x, ÷)
2. Evaluate each postfix operation by using standard stack operations and check if the result is equal to the goal

An additional constraint that I placed upon myself for this project was to implement all permutations and combinations library functions without using external mathematical libraries.  I initially wrote all the code in python using the wonderful [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) library but wanted to write a pure client-side web version of it so I didn't need to spin up a server.

### (1) Generate all possible post-fix expressions

The first step is to generate a list of all possible expressions that are possible with the given train carriage numbers and the list of operations. Let us say the numbers in the train carriage are 1, 2, 3 and 4. Let us also suppose we are using the standard arithmetic operations used in the basic variant of the game  (+, –, x, ÷).

#### Number permutations

We generate all possible permutations of the train carriage numbers using the following code.

```javascript
// permutations(items): generates all possible permutations without
// repetition of the items list in lexicographical order.
// ------------------
// Adapted from: Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhaus%E2%80%93Johnson%E2%80%93Trotter_algorithm
const permutations = (items) => {
  // Base case: If there is a single item,
  // return the item inside of a list so it
  // can be later concatenated in General case.
  if (items.length === 1) return [items];
  // General case: Recursively call permutations
  // for items list without the last item.
  let tail = permutations(items.slice(1));
  let perms = [];
  tail.forEach(sub => {
    // Then, insert first number into every
    // possible position of 'sub'-permutation.
    sub.forEach((_, j) => {
      const pre = sub.slice(0, j);
      const mid = items[0];
      const post = sub.slice(j);
      // Push each permutation = arranging [pre, mid, post]
      perms.push(pre.concat([mid], post));
    })
  });
  return perms;
};
```

As an example, calling `permutations(['a', 'b', 'c'])` returns 3! (= 6) permutations of the input list.

```javascript
[['a', 'b', 'c'],  // permutation 1
 ['b', 'a', 'c'],  // permutation 2
 ['b', 'c', 'a'],  // permutation 3
 ['a', 'c', 'b'],  // permutation 4
 ['c', 'a', 'b'],  // permutation 5
 ['c', 'b', 'a']]  // permutation 6
```

#### Operator combinations

Next, we find the all combinations of operations that can be slipped between the numbers to find an answer.

By definition, if you have 4 carriage numbers in your train carriage, you need to pick the 3 (4-1) operations with repetition that will be placed in between the numbers.

```javascript
// product(items, r): Generates r-length combinations of items with
// repetition (akin to generating r-length cartesian products of the
// items array).
const product = (items, r) => {
  // Duplicate items array r times (to use as a placeholder)
  let placeholder = Array(r).fill(items);
  // Run through the placeholder r times and build up the
  // combinations by 1 item at at time.
  return placeholder.reduce((acc, curr) => {
    // For every accumulated item,
    return acc.flatMap(a => {
      // Tack on each of the items to the end of each accumulated
      // item
      return curr.map(c => a.concat(c))
    });
  });
};
```

The combinations are produced by generting r-length combinations of the numbers list with repetition. 

As an example, `product(['a', 'b', 'c'], 2)` would generate 2-length combinations with repetitions would result in:

```javascript
['aa', 'ab', 'ac',
 'ba', 'bb', 'bc',
 'ca', 'cb', 'cc']
```

The reason it is viable to generate all possible number & operation combination in the first place is because the sample space of all possibilities is quite small. For example, with 4 numbers permutations (i.e. 4! = 24) and 4 standard operations with 3 operations chosen with  [repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination#Number_of_combinations_with_repetition) (i.e. n=4, k=3 means 6C3 = 20) there are only 24 × 20 = 480  total evaluations that need to be performed.

Every number permutation and operator combination are weaved together to create a post-fix expression.

For example, if `numbers` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and operators is `[+,-,×]`, then the resulting post-fix expression from the output of this function would be: `12+3-4×`.

```javascript
const makePostFixExpr = (numList, opList) => {
  let expr = [numList[0]];
  let rest = numList.slice(1);
  rest.forEach((r, i) => {
    expr = expr.concat([r, opList[i]]);
  });
  return expr;
};
```

We now have a way to generate postfix expressioons given a list of numbers and a list of operators. 

Next, we work on writing the code that will read every generated post-fix expression in order to check whether it is equal to the goal.

### (2) Evaluate post-fix expressions using a stack

Now that we have generated all 480 post-fix expressions, we need to evaluate them to check if we've reached our goal number!

Post-fix operations are an efficient representation of expressions because they can be parsed and evaluated via standard stack operations.

I built my own very basic expression evaluator as a way to learn from scratch. The input to the evaluator is a post-fix expression to be evaluated represented as an array. [pop()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop) was used to retrieve tokens one by one from the stack.

The idea is simple, everytime you retrieve an operation (check if `isNan(token)` is `true`) then retrieve the next two numbers of the stack and perform the operation on. Repeat the process for each element in the stack. The result is a single number evaluated.

If the token from the stack is a number, then simply push it onto the stack so that it can be evaluated.

```javascript
const evaluate = (expr) => {
  let stack = [];
  expr.forEach((tok) => {
    let token = parseInt(tok, 10);
    if (isNaN(token)) {
      // is operator
      let operator = tok;
      // e.g. expr = [4, 2, -]
      //     stack = [4] -> [4, 2] -> [4, 2, -]
      //     popped: -, then 2 ('first') and then 4 ('second')
      //     e.g. stack.push(second-first) = stack.push(4-2);
      let first = stack.pop();   // would pop 2 ('first')
      let second = stack.pop();  // would pop 4 ('second')
      switch (operator) {
        case "+":
          stack.push(second + first);
          break;
        case "-":
          stack.push(second - first);
          break;
        case "*":
          stack.push(second * first);
          break;
        case "/":
          stack.push(second / first);
          break;
        case "^":
          stack.push(Math.pow(second, first));
          break;
        // case "√":
        //   stack.push(Math.pow(second, 1 / first));
        //   break;
        default:
          console.log('A problem has occurred.');
      }
    } else {
      // is number
      stack.push(token);
    }
  });
  return stack.pop();
};
```

Lastly, simply check if the resulting number is equivalent to the target that the user has in mind (e.g. 10) and display the result if so.
