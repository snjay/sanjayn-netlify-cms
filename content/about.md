Hi, I'm Sanjay

I've recently graduated from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) with a double degree in Software Engineering (Honours) and Commerce.

Currently, I work as a software engineer involved in startups both as an engineer and a [founder](https://lumaway.com).

Feel free to shoot me an email at sanjay (at) sanjayn.com if you want to get in touch :)
